// types reference

// you can make ints and floats and stuff
// swift is smart so it figures types automatically kind of
let thisIsAnInt = 1
let thisIsAFloat = 2.3

// but you can hard code and specify the type if you'd like
// this returns 1.0 because it's turned into a float(ing point decimal)
let thisIsAnotherFloat: Float = 1

// bools exist which are pretty sweet
// this is Swift so this would be true
var isThisSwift = true
// and this would not be, unfortunately
var isThisRuby  = false

// also
// `println` is a function you can use to print stuff
println("Hello World") // ha classic

// string interpolation looks weird in Swift but it works so
var name = "josh" // this is a string btw
println("hi my name is \(name)")
